## Making Changes

Run `tsc npx -w` to tell the TypeScript compiler to watch for changes. Then, open index.html in the browser. Any changes you make the the HTML, CSS or TypeScript should be updated on refresh.

To push changes to production, run `node build/build.js`. This should mirror any changes made to the site to the copy of the site in the `docs` directory, the directory from which the site is served.
